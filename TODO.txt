TO DO
--------

- Add reminder if Index is outdated
- Add notification to select folder if user presses Build Index on main form during first run
- Think of what additional columns it is useful to show in search results
- Do we need possibility to select two and more folders for indexing? Now you can select only one folder on entire disk (C: and D:)
