TO DO
--------
- looks like wildcards search with '?' wildcard does not work well
- possibility to make search while FS is being indexed in background
- Option to specify IndexDB location
- Search history in edit box - DONE
- GUI: show row mouse over - DONE
- Match whole word option. When search term should have word separators in both sides 
- Add possibility to search for composite folders e.g. 'source\repos'
- Highlight search term in search results list - DONE
- "Denied" folders mark with special icon in the list.
- Add possibility to select a subfolder to make search to. Subfolder inside of existing index top folder.
- Add reminder if Index is outdated - DONE (14 days reminder)
- Add notification to select folder if user presses Build Index on main form during first run - DONE 
- Think of what additional columns it is useful to show in search results
- Do we need possibility to select two and more folders for indexing? Now you can select only one folder on entire disk (C: and D:)
