TO DO
--------

- Add possibility to select a subfolder to make search to. Subfolder inside of existing index top folder.
- Add reminder if Index is outdated - DONE (14 days reminder)
- Add notification to select folder if user presses Build Index on main form during first run - DONE 
- Think of what additional columns it is useful to show in search results
- Do we need possibility to select two and more folders for indexing? Now you can select only one folder on entire disk (C: and D:)
